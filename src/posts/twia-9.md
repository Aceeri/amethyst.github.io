## Announcements

We have halted the *This Week in Amethyst* due to some slow progress and not having much to show. We will move to a more monthly basis now as more pieces are coming into place.

With that out of the way. What have we been up too in the past few months? Well, a lot. The most notable thing is that we finally have a few working examples including a version of [pong](https://github.com/amethyst/amethyst/tree/develop/examples/04_pong).



## What's cooking on develop?

### Notable additions

* [Specs](specs) and [gfx-rs](gfx) have both been integrated into Amethyst.

* [GFX based renerer] has been implemented! Thanks to [@csherratt](cs)!

* The base for [YAML Config](p61) loading has been done. Thanks to [@Aceeri](ac).

* More work has gone into the glue for all the components in the [amethyst_context crate](p63) thanks [@nchashch](nc).

* The [default renderer processor](p85) has been merged. This includes the new pong example. Thanks again to [@nchashch](nc) brilliant work!
