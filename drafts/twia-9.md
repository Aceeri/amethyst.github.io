## Announcements

[Lukas Schmierer][ls] is working on a set of performance benchmarks for popular
entity-component-system (ECS) libraries in Rust. See the [ecs_bench][eb] repo
for more details.

[Colin Sherratt][cs] has started prototyping a simple forward renderer that
uses [GFX][gf] at its core. You can follow his progress on the `renderer` branch
of [csherrat/amethyst][re].

and configuration management within the engine. Check out the `resources`

## What's cooking on master?

### Notable additions

* [Version 0.3.0 of Amethyst was released!][er] The renderer and ECS branches
  were merged into the mainline, and [amethyst_ecs][ae] was finally published
  to Crates.io. The ECS library's API is still unstable (see issue [#10][e10]
  for the current status), but it's getting there. For a more mature
  alternative, please check out @[Oflor][of]'s [Zircon][zi] library.
* [The build tool gained the `deploy` subcommand.][de] This builds your project
  in release mode, runs all your unit and integration tests, compresses your
  game assets, and outputs everything to a directory called `deploy`.
* The build tool now also is capable of
  [checking for malformed game projects][mg] and also
  [tweaking Cargo features][cf] in preparation for the proposed "shards"
  extension system (issue [#34][e34]).
