## What's cooking on master?

### Notable additions

* As you can tell, we have an official website! It is hosted on
  [GitHub Pages][gp] and made with [Cobalt][co], a static website generator
  similar to Jekyll written in Rust. Future *This Week in Amethyst* posts will
  be written collaboratively with public pull requests, much like *This Week in
  Rust* already does. Thanks to @[Aceeri][ac] and @[LucioFranco][lf] for the
  excellent effort!
* [Amethyst is now an organization on GitHub!][e27] All the Amethyst
  repositories have been transferred to this new organization, and
  [the wiki][wi] is now completely open for collaborators to edit.
* [The Gitter chat has been split into multiple rooms][gc] to help keep
  conversations organized and reduce overall noise. Looks much nicer!

### Breaking changes

* Because of the repository restructuring on GitHub, some links may be broken.
  We will be fixing old links, especially on old *TWIA* articles, to ensure
  continuity. If you come across other broken links, please let us know on the
  [amethyst/website][wg] room on Gitter and we'll go fix it!

[wg]: https://gitter.im/amethyst/website

* [The old WordPress blog][ob] is being discontinued in favor of this website.
  We will keep it up for the forseeable future to keep old links intact, but it
  will no longer be updated. Please update your bookmarks and [RSS feeds][rf]!
